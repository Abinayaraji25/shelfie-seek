# Smart Shelf

Build a complete, interactive web application called “Smart Library Book Finder”.

IMPORTANT: I do NOT want a code explanation or a code-only response. Build the actual working application with a modern, polished and fully interactive UI. The application should simulate a real college library system.

🎯 Main Purpose

The application should allow a college student to:

Register → Login → Search for a Book → Check Availability → Find Rack & Shelf → Borrow/Reserve the Book → View Borrowed Books → Return the Book

The complete student journey should be realistic and easy to demonstrate.

🏆 20. FINAL USER JOURNEY

The final application should demonstrate this complete flow:

IMPORTANT FINAL INSTRUCTION

Do not give me a tutorial or only source code.

Actually build the working application/prototype with all the above pages, navigation, sample books, search functionality, registration/login flow, borrowing flow, return flow, and modern UI.

The result should be suitable for a college Design Thinking – Project Better Tomorrow demonstration.
